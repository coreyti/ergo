# Workspace

This is an exploration into setting up a sort of "workspace" that combines the following in some (hopefully elegant) way.

## Parts

- A GitHub ["template" repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)
- A workspace structure that incorporates concepts from:
  - Multi-root workspaces
  - Monorepo workflows
  - Conventions taken from `*NIX` (e.g., as seen in Golang projects, but more so)
- `direnv`
- `dotenv`
- `asdf`
- `Brewfile`

## Additional Intentions/Considerations

- The monorepo aspect should likely be optional, as many teams and individuals will not be interested in such an approach.

## Why "ergo"

You tell me ;)
