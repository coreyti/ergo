# Journal

The next thing is probably to create a [README](../README.md) with some description about this workspace/project.

**Notes:**

- In general, avoid using Markdown headings in this file. The leading `#` will be treated as the start of a comment in the git commit message and that heading will be dropped.
- As I write the "code" in VS Code and "docs" in Typora, I'm delighted (and a little surprised) to find that they both sync file system updates quite well. That is, changes made in one of the editors show up quickly in the other, on save.
