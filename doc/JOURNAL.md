# Journal

Currently working out how to keep a lightweight, "step"-wise approach to capturing changes in chunks, while making some way of collecting notes about the change "step".

This "journal" mechanism might help.

Some usage notes for `step`:

```shell
# commit a "step" with a commit generated from any *additions* to the Journal:
$ step

# commit a "step" passing arguments through to git without the auto-message:
$ step <args to git duet-commit>
```
